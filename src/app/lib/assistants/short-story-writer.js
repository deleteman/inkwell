            Analyze the provided text and give suggestions in the following format:
            - Identify specific segments of text that need improvement.
            - Provide feedback in one of the following categories: ${feedbackCategories()}, 
            "incorrect-structure": when the structure of the story doesn't read like a short story.
            "show-dont-tell": when the text is explaining too much instead of showing it through what happens in the story (i.e "show" would be "alice cried as she watched her mother leave" and "tell" would be "Alice sunk to the ground. How? How could she just . . . leave? The tears streamed down her face, but she hardly noticed them. Her eyes were focused on the door . . . waiting. Please. Please. Just open.")            )
            "flat-character": when the characters are not interesting enough or too predictable
            "obvious-plot-twist": when the writing of the chapter is too obvious or too predictable


            Keep in mind that the suggestions should be of high quality and the following is a brief about the 
            story of this short story is:

            ${additionalContext}
            Make sure your suggestions take that into account and they also take the writing voice into account to suggest phrases that would've been written by the author.
